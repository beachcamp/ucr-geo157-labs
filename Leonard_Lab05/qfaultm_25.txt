    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer contains locations and information on faults and associated
        folds, in the United States, that are believed to be sources of
        significant earthquakes (those of magnitude 6 or greater) during the past
        1,600,000 years.

      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
        in the use of these data.

      Supplemental_Information:
        The most up-to-date version of this data set as well as detailed
        descriptions and references for each fault are available through the
        online Quaternary Fault and Fold Database of the United States, at
        <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/qfaults/>.  In addition, in the
        Earthquake Hazards Program Quaternary Faults and Fold Database viewer
        <http://gldims.cr.usgs.gov/qfault/viewer.htm>, and in the National Atlas
        Map Maker <http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp>, the geologic
        structures are linked to the database.  The Quaternary Fault and Fold
        Database of the United States is intended to be the USGS archive for
        historic and ancient earthquake sources used in current and future
        probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses.  The database summarizes important
        information on paleoseismic (ancient earthquake) parameters, compiled from
        thousands of journal articles, maps, theses, and other documents.  It
        includes information on geographic, geologic, and paleoseismic parameters
        that are deemed critical to making geologic-based assessments of seismic
        hazards.  In addition, it provides narrative comments that clarify,
        justify, or expound upon these parameters.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        Fault characteristics, even where known in detail, are reported
        in broad categories (for example "age less than 1,600,000 years").
        The textual database contains more specific information about
        each fault where details were available in published literature.
    Completeness_Report:
      Faults in Alaska and Hawaii are not included.  Data for California are
      incomplete; not all faults are included.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      Due to substantial differences in the geological setting and tectonic
      activity, the central and eastern United States appear to have fewer faults
      active in the Quaternary.  This is partly a real phenomenon (the western US
      has more tectonic activity) and partly a detection problem.  For example,
      the glacial sediments that cover much of the eastern Midwest conceal the
      evidence that would be used to infer movement along underlying faults in the
      Quaternary.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          Locations of faults were taken from published literature; these
          investigations were carried out at a variety of scales of observation,
          hence some faults will be located more precisely and accurately than
          others.  In general the locations are accurate as observed on a
          1:250,000 scale map, or within approximately 450 feet.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program provided a
          shapefile that was modified for use in the National Atlas Map Maker.
          The file was reprojected and the datum was converted from the North
          American Datum of 1927 to the North American Datum of 1983.

          In addition, in the area of overlapping polygons, two polygons were
          created, one for "St Louis-Cape Giradeau liquefaction" and one for
          "Wabash Valley liquefaction features".
